For Hunter, 

1. For some reason, I could not get the header or footer to work for my pages. I think my directories were set up wrong for that. 
2. The .html and .css pages are similar to yours. They are pretty self explanatory. 
3. The .js files are similar to yours. However, you will have to change some URLs so that buttons bring you to the right page. I have them labelled in the comments.
4. The .php files are the most confusing. I tried commenting them. "choose.php" should be called whenever a user clicks on a review. Then, it chooses whether to call "viewReview.php" or "viewOwnReview.php." ViewOwnReview allows the user to delete the review. 
5. You will have to change URLs for some of the .php files too. (createReview.php, viewReview.php)
6. For createReview.php and choose.php, I couldn't test $_SESSION properly. I labelled where you may need to double check, but I think it will work as is. If any of the forms show up blank, it is most likely an issue with $_SESSION. 
7. I didn't use separate directories, so all of my files are in a folder named Alex.
